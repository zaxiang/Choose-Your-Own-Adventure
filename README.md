# Choose Your Own Adventure
A C++ choose-your-own-adventure(CYOA) story game

The program reads a story provided in a directory containing text files, where each file represents a page of the story. Pages include choices that lead to other pages, with some pages being WIN or LOSE conditions. The project consists of several steps:

Step 1: Create C++ classes to represent the story and a program (cyoa-step1) that prints the pages of the story.

Step 2: Develop a program (cyoa-step2) that reads the story and allows users to interactively navigate through it. Ensure that the story has valid connections between pages and includes WIN and LOSE conditions.

Step 3: Implement a program (cyoa-step3) that identifies all cycle-free ways to win the story. Print each winning path without repeating pages. Handle situations where the story may be unwinnable.

Step 4: Enhance the story with the ability to remember choices made on previous pages. Introduce variables and conditional choices based on these variables. Develop a program (cyoa-step4) that handles these new features.

Developed a "choose your own adventure" (CYOA) story game in C++, allowing users to navigate through interactive stories with branching paths and multiple endings.\
Implemented robust error handling and validation to ensure story coherence and user experience integrity, including verifying page connections, WIN/LOSE conditions, and cycle-free winning paths.\
Utilized C++ classes and STL containers to create a flexible and scalable architecture, emphasizing code reusability and maintainability across multiple project phases.
